# Max-Flow Min-Cut Analysis - Network Dynamics and Learning Lecture Project 1

## üìú Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the first individual project in the "Network Dynamics and Learning" course at Politecnico di Torino (2023/2024). The project focuses on **network flow optimization problems**, including:
- Max-Flow Min-Cut problems.
- Bipartite Graphs and Perfect Matching.
- Network Flow Optimization in real-world contexts like highway networks.

## üîç Problem Description
The project explores several key problems in network dynamics:
1. **Max-Flow Min-Cut**: Analyze and determine:
   - Minimum aggregate capacity removal for no feasible flow.
   - Maximum aggregate capacity removal without affecting throughput.
   - Distribution of extra capacities to maximize throughput.
   
2. **Bipartite Graphs**:
   - Find perfect matchings.
   - Optimize assignments under capacity constraints.
   - Determine optimal book redistribution to maximize matches.

3. **Highway Network Optimization**:
   - Shortest path calculations.
   - Maximum flow between intersections.
   - Social optimum and Wardrop equilibrium flow analysis with toll implementation.
